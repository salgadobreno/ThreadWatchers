Hi, ThreadWatchers is a concept project, it's meant to be a news aggregator
separated by topics of special interest('thread'), with a completely different
kind of interface designed to
provide the big picture view of the happenings of it. It's also an
experiment( I don't really know if anyone agrees this has relevancy, what do you think? salgado.breno@gmail.com ) and development excercise :b

Rationale behind this:
=====================

.

* FOMO(Fear of Missing Out): 
New's binge kind of sucks because it's like a vice, you start
keeping this threads in your head and you can't help but keep on
reading every new story on it, a collaborative news aggregator on that specific topic
could assist in maintaining you informed while taking out the sensation
of "damn, that's a big article but now I'll have to read it to update
the picture of the situation in my mind".

* Our 'Head Threads' aren't shareable: 
Say you live in a violent
neighborhood and you know someone who's from somewhere where they can't see
it, the stories you hear and things you see will mold your discernment
on an issue, at the same time, nothing says people in different
backgrounds will be able to symphatize, they may not think it's relevant
because they can't see it(and this is just natural) and there's no way to transfer this kind of
thing, but as you're observing something, if you're also documenting it,
you can make a better point. (Also touches on the issue that activists
are generally seen as bores for trying to make your mind on something)

* More eyes = more accountability
why aren't we 'surveilling' governments
back? In the current information/noise pandemonium it's way easy to
have people lose focus on.. anything, really, or be sapping around
from one to another eternally, this isn't very productive.

* The 'different interface' would be something like Simile Timeline, I
think it does a nice job at giving you the big picture of events. I'm
thinking of using Kuzog's rewrite: http://timeline.kusog.org/, for
a prototype and later on(if there's later on) I'd like to build a custom D3 one(http://bl.ocks.org/bunkat/1962173 is probably a good starting point) to improve on
the visuals and to possibilitate new features like real-time updating,
etc.
